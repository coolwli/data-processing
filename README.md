## Dynamic Data Visualization with Excel Download

My code reads data dynamically from a table and generates a pie chart for each column. It also enables you to download the charts as Excel files.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Insert your data into the table.
3. Install the EPPlus package using NuGet Package Manager and add other References in your project.
4. Run the code.
